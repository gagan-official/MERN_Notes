### React.js vs Next.js:
```
React is a library focused purely on building UI components, while Next.js is a React framework that adds server-side rendering, routing, and API endpoints.

Next.js helps improve SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server and caching static content.

React is SPA and Next is Hybrid (because of multiple renderings - SSR/CSR/SSG/ISR).

### Can We Write React Code Without JSX and With ES6?
```
Yes, internally uses React.createElement, but JSX improves readability and dev experience.

React was made up using modern ES6 features like classes and modules (more like destructuring, arrow functions, anything came under ES6).
